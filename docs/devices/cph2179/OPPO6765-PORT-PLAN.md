# oppo6765 port plan

This document records the plan for adapting the Cactarwin/XNU work to the OPPO
A15s. **`oppo6765` is the project codename**; it does not claim that the OPPO
board is identical to Redmi 6A `cactus`.

## Device identity

- Product/model: OPPO A15s, `CPH2179`.
- Android device string: `OP4F2F`.
- Project codename: `oppo6765`.
- Platform/SoC family: MediaTek MT6765; the live tree reports `MT6765V/CB`.
- Stock software evidence: Android 10, Linux 4.9.190+, 4 GB LPDDR4X,
  720 x 1600 display. See the local device inventory; do not copy device dumps
  or identifiers containing serial/calibration data into this repository.

## What the live device tree currently indicates

These are observations from `device/oppo_lfdt.dts`, not yet a complete XNU
platform configuration:

- Eight Cortex-A53 CPU nodes, with MPIDR values `0..3` and `0x100..0x103`.
- DRAM node starts at `0x40000000` and declares a 4 GiB range. The tree also
  contains many MediaTek reserved-memory regions; the declared DRAM range is
  not a safe allocation map by itself.
- GICv3 distributor at `0x0c000000`, redistributor region at `0x0c100000`.
- ARMv8 architectural timer at 13 MHz; the virtual timer is listed as PPI
  11 (architectural INTID 27).
- The FDT has a static memory span from `0x40000000` through `0x13fffffff`.
  Its `/reserved-memory` tree includes fixed `reg` reservations as well as
  dynamically sized/aligned reservations (`size`, `alignment`, and
  `alloc-ranges`). Do not turn the DRAM span into an XNU allocator range until
  those dynamic reservations, FDT reserve-map entries, and bootloader payloads
  have been reconciled.
- Android boot image is header v2 with a device-tree handoff. The exact LK
  entry state, memory reservations, and DTB/DTBO selection still need to be
  confirmed from the boot path used for an XNU payload.

## OPPO A15 kernel source available locally

`../device/A15/` is an OPPO-published MT6765 kernel source checkout (local
revision `952bd94cf`). It contains SoC DTS `kernel-4.9/arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt6765.dts`,
board overlays `oppo6765.dts` and `oppo6765_20271.dts`, plus the matching
`oppo6765_defconfig` and MediaTek/OPPO drivers. This is a closer hardware
reference for `oppo6765` than Cactus's board code.

Initial comparison evidence:

- The live CPH2179 tree and the A15 overlay both describe an OPPO MT6765
  platform and 720 x 1600 touch coordinates with an 18 x 32 sensor matrix.
- Both include the Himax, Ilitek, and NovaTek touchscreen family, including
  NT36525B. The live CPH2179 tree also lists Focal FT8006S, so the selected
  controller/firmware still needs confirmation.
- The A15 source's `oppo6765` and `oppo6765_20271` overlays differ in some
  board peripherals and GPIO assignments. The CPH2179 live tree and selected
  DTBO must determine which values apply; the shared `oppo6765` string alone
  does not settle that.
- The captured `dtbo.img` has two entries. The live tree's bootargs say
  `androidboot.dtbo_idx=1`, selecting entry 1. Entry 1 includes the
  `aw87359` speaker amplifier node also present in
  `oppo6765_20271.dts`; entry 0 does not. This is strong evidence that the
  20271 overlay is the relevant source variant. Entry 1 also contains the
  Focal touchscreen option, matching the live tree; retain that option in the
  comparison rather than assuming the older checked-in source is exhaustive.

Use the Linux source to recover register maps, clocks, reset/power sequences,
interrupt wiring, DMA constraints, and confirmed board variants. Linux drivers
are not directly reusable as XNU drivers; port only after the relevant device
and initialization sequence match the CPH2179 live tree.

The physical OPPO A15 used for this source tree is not available. Hardware
validation must use the user's OPPO A15s (`CPH2179`); do not treat the A15
source checkout as proof that a particular peripheral or variant is present.

## Cactus work that must be revalidated

The Cactus board config contains fixed framebuffer addresses and dimensions,
GIC setup, CPU topology, timer assumptions, and 4 KiB hardware / 16 KiB XNU
software-page settings. Some architectural facts may be shared by these MTK
devices, but none of the board addresses, memory layout, reserved regions,
panel settings, or bootloader assumptions should be inherited without OPPO
evidence. The Cactus Stage 79 PID1 and virtual-RAMDisk work is later-stage XNU
work; it does not establish that the OPPO shim or board initialization works.

## First implementation milestone

Produce an OPPO handoff profile and a hardware comparison from the A15 kernel
source and CPH2179 live tree before adding an `OPPO6765` XNU machine
configuration:

1. Decode the stock boot image and selected DTB/DTBO. Record the actual entry
   exception level, registers/arguments, kernel and initrd placement, FDT
   address, and all reserved ranges. Resolve the FDT reserve map and dynamic
   reserved-memory requests, then check payload overlap offline.
2. Compare the live FDT's CPU, GIC, timer, memory, reserved-memory, and
   peripheral nodes with the A15 SoC DTS, both OPPO board overlays, and the
   Cactus config. Mark each setting as verified for CPH2179, different, or
   unknown; do not infer board identity from a shared MT6765 label.
3. Make a minimal shim-only entry/return diagnostic that confirms the OPPO
   bootloader handoff without jumping into XNU. Keep the existing Android and
   recovery paths intact while validating how to recover from a failed boot.
4. Only then add an isolated `OPPO6765` machine configuration and test an
   instrumented XNU entry with a one-core baseline. Add VM, interrupt, timer,
   storage, and display support as separate measured milestones.

## Safety and evidence rules

- Do not use a Cactus image or write a Cactus framebuffer/GIC/memory constant
  onto the OPPO.
- The local device notes report that `fastboot boot` does not boot the supplied
  image and may reboot after about 20 seconds. The user reports that the
  CPH2179 bootloader is unlocked and test images can be flashed to `boot`.
  Prepare and verify a shim-only image and confirm a reliable recovery route
  before any boot-partition trial; do not use an unverified Cactus image.
- Keep raw partition images, DT dumps with identifiers, calibration partitions,
  and generated firmware out of Git.
- Label results as built, shim-entered, XNU-entered, or XNU-progressed. A
  successful build or a visible bootloader logo is not proof of XNU execution.
